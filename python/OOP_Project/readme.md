# ðŸ§  Python OOP Lab Project

This project is an object-oriented programming (OOP) simulation written in Python.  
It models a real-life scenario of employees, cars, and an office environment, and is based on lab requirements provided by ITI.

## ðŸ“˜ Story

> "Samy is an employee. He works in ITI and owns a Fiat 128 car.  
> He goes every day (except weekends) to ITI Smart Village Office, which is 20km away."

The project simulates Samy's (and other employees') day-to-day life including sleeping, eating, working, driving, being late, and getting rewarded or punished.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

The `main.py` includes scenarios like:
- Hiring employees
- Driving cars to work
- Checking if employees are late
- Employee actions (sleep, eat, buy)
- Sending emails

You can run the test file using:
```bash
python main.py
```
